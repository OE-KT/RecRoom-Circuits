# Guide On how to Create a pvp system!
:::note
This requires knowledge of basic Circuits an player definition boards
:::

First you will need a Player definition board.

Next you will need to edit into the board and then add these chips.
1. int variable
1. Event receiver
1. subtract

We will be using the rec room's projectile hit player event to register when the player is hit.

next configure the Event resivers's event to `projectile hit player`.

and configure the int variable and rename it to `health` and set the value to whatever you want (this will most likely be the max health)
Now hit submit.

Next we will take away health every time the player is hit,
To do this first wire the Circuits as shown

Then wire the execute ports as so.

Now every time you hit a player with a projectile it will deal the appropriate amount of damage.
:::tip
You can add math chips to modify the damage coming in!
:::
Now let's make it so the players die when they reach 0 health.

Add an `Less than or equal to` chip and an `if` chip
and wire it like so

Next add and `respawn point respawn player` chip and wire the `then` output to the input on the `respawn point respawn player` chip

Like this

Now back over here, add an self chip

Now wire the self chip output to the Player port on the `Respawn point respawn player` chip.

Now to reset the player heath, clone the health variable we created earlier and set the input port to 100.
than drag the variable next to the `Respawn point respawn player`


Now wire the execute port on the `respawn point respawn player to the health variable execute port.
Now when your health gets to 0 you respawn!
the Circuits should look like this know

If you want to add a way to see the health use your other knowledge of showing info to the player? Don't know yet
Well follow this non existing guide to learn how to show the player info!
